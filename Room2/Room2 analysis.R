# In this file I will discuss the first second room (with triangle in front of the door) and
# compare it to the standard room (room 1). I kept the width of the door fixed. As could be seen in the file
# "Finding optimal triangle position" the triangle has a distance to the door (when focussing on the vertical
# side of the triangle) of 35 pixels ( it is at x-position 665). Now we will compare the mean exit time for room 1
# and room 2 for the case with one door and do robustness-checks using 2 doors, random sizes/weight and visibility.
# Also I will plot a graph of the average exit times per person against the number of players left. This gives an 
# indication in how fluently the system is evacuated. For the randomized case the triangle is at x = 660 (to allow fatter 
# people to leave)
